## Quick Start

`yarn && yarn start`

Developed and tested with `yarn 1.21.1` and `node v14.18.2`.

## Tech

- bootstrapped with Create React App
- TypeScript (must-have)
- wouter library for routing (didn't want to use React Router again)
- GraphQL (used for the first time, love it), Apollo Client
- CSS modules, scss
- react-testing-library (used for the first time, want to learn; I have been using Enzyme/Cypress in commercial projects so far)

## Available Scripts

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
